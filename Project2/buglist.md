# CSci 5801 Project2 - Team3 - VotingSystem - Bug List

Num | Description of bug | Location of bug | Steps to recreate bug/test case | Root cause analysis
--- | --- | -- | ---- | ---
1 | When the software is run with just one command line argument that is not '-m' such as ./VotingSystem -t, it segfaults. | voting_system.cc | run system with ./VotingSystem -t | Check for argv[2] when argc==2
2 | In manual file input mode, the same ballot file can get processed more than once if a user inputs the file more than once | ballot_file_processor.cc | Start VotingSystem with command line input '-m', choose input file, enter the same file twice | No checking for duplicate files, deemed low risk since a user cannot select a file twice in our GUI file selector
3 | If an STV election ballot file is selected for plurality election, ballot file processor does not raise flag. However, election result would be correct based on which candidate is ranked 1. | ballot_file_processor.cc | Run VotingSystem, select plurality election, select stv ballot files | No file election type checking, deemed low risk, since plurality files will be put on invalid ballot list in an stv election, while stv files run correctly for a plurality election
4 | The month in the datetime string returned by GetTimeStamp function is off by 1 | voting_system.cc | run an election then check the datetime string in log file name and invalid ballot file name | Month value returned by ctime LocalTime is off by 1
5 | When there are more seats than candidates, stv election result display truncate number of seats to number of candidates, while plurality result display original number of seats | plurality_election.cc, stv_election.cc | run an stv election with more seats than candidates, then run a plurality election with more seats than candidates, compare result display | stv_election display results with number of seats filled, while plurality_election display results with number of seats input by user. This does not affect how the election is run
6 | When multiple ballot files are selected for an stv election, there are multiple invalid ballots log entry in log file | ballot_file_processor.cc | run an stv election with multiple ballot files, then check log file | Logging of invalid ballot list is called every time a file is processed. The result is correct, just multiple logging lines.
