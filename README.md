# Ranked-Choice and Plurality Voting System
This was a project for CSCI 5801 Software Engineering at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in spring 2020 (orignally hosted on github.umn.edu).

Worked with a team of 4 to design and implement an object oriented ranked-choice and plurality voting system in C++, first following a complete Waterfall process for early iterations and then Agile Scrum sprints for later iterations. Accommodates any number of candidates, ballots, and ballot files, and can be run from a GUI implementation or from the command line.

Check out:
- /Project1 for the first (Waterfall) iteration of the project,
- /Project2 for the second (Agile Scrum) iteration of the project, as well as the sprint and product backlogs,
- /SRS for the Software Requirements Sepcification, and
- /SDD for UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams, and the Software Design Document.

Created with Hailin Archer (deak0007), Bryan Baker (bake1358), and Colin Kluegel (klue0037) of Seagate / UMN CSCI master's students.
