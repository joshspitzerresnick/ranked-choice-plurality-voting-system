# Ranked-Choice and Plurality Voting System
This was a project for CSCI 5801 Software Engineering at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in spring 2020 (orignally hosted on github.umn.edu).

Worked with a team of 4 to design and implement an object oriented ranked-choice and plurality voting system in C++, first following a complete Waterfall process for early iterations and then Agile Scrum sprints for later iterations. Accommodates any number of candidates, elected seats, ballots, and ballot files (.csv), and can be run from a GUI implementation or from the command line.

Check out:
- /Project1 for the first (Waterfall) iteration of the project,
- /Project2 for the second (Agile Scrum) iteration of the project, as well as the sprint and product backlogs,
- /SRS for the Software Requirements Specification, and
- /SDD for UML class, sequence, and activity diagrams, and the Software Design Document.

Created with Hailin Archer (deak0007), Bryan Baker (bake1358), and Colin Kluegel (klue0037) of Seagate / UMN CSCI master's students.
